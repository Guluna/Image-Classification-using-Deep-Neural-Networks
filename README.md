# Image-Classification-using-Deep-Neural-Networks

This project aims to tackle the image classification problem using neural network techniques and study whether image variation in grayscale and RGB could impact the classification process. We chose the Intel Image Classification data set from Kaggle. This dataset contains over 25,000 total images of size 150 x 150 pixels. Among them, 14,034 are labeled as training data in six categories: mountain, street, glacier, building, sea, and forest. Twenty percent of the training data is split out as the validation set. Also, 3,000 images are testing data, and 7,000 are for prediction use.

Based on the results of all the Neural Networks (Traditional, Convolution, Pretrained etc) we applied on image data set, the model that gave us the best result turns out to be VGG-16 with Test set Accuracy of 0.8523.
